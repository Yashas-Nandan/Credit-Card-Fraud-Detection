# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This repository implements a machine learning solution for detecting credit card fraud. The project utilizes advanced data preprocessing, model building, and adversarial training techniques to create a robust model capable of identifying fraudulent transactions.

## Features

### Data Preprocessing:

-Handles missing values and scales features.
-Implements SMOTE for class imbalance.
-Performs feature selection and correlation analysis.

### Model Building:

-Builds a neural network with multiple hidden layers for binary classification.
-Utilizes advanced techniques like hyperparameter tuning and class weights to optimize performance.

### Adversarial Training:

-Incorporates adversarial examples to strengthen the model against attacks.
-Uses gradient masking and defensive distillation techniques.

### Model Evaluation:

-Evaluates performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.
-Generates confusion matrices and SHAP visualizations for explainability.

### Deployment:

-Implements a user-friendly web application using Streamlit for real-time fraud detection.
-Features interactive visualizations and a prediction tool for user input.
